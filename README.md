The program generates the Fibonacci sequence using both an iterative and a recursive approach.<br>

In the iterative approach, it uses a loop to calculate each Fibonacci number by updating two variables (a and b) with the last two Fibonacci numbers. This method is more efficient, especially for larger values of n, because it only performs a single loop.<br>

In the recursive approach, the function calls itself to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. However, this method is slower for large n because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times, resulting in exponential time complexity.<br>

If you test this on n = 40, youâ€™ll notice a stark contrast in the performance between the two methods.<br>

The iterative approach is faster and more efficient, while the recursive approach, though elegant, becomes inefficient for larger inputs due to repeated calculations.<br>
